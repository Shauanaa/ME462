## üéØ Project Abstract

This project combines the excitement of air hockey with cutting-edge robotics technology. It features a fully automated air hockey table and a mini robot designed for various tasks. The aim is to showcase the integration of mechanical engineering and software development in creating interactive and entertaining systems.

## üèí AirHockey

### Mechanical

Our air hockey table is equipped with:

- High-powered air blowers for frictionless puck movement
- Reinforced playing surface for durability
- LED lighting system for enhanced gameplay experience
- Automatic puck return mechanism

### Software

The air hockey system is powered by:

- Computer vision algorithms for real-time puck tracking
- AI-driven opponent simulation
- User interface for game settings and score tracking
- Integration with the mini robot for autonomous gameplay

## ü§ñ Mini Robot

### Mechanical

The mini robot features:

- Compact, agile design for quick movements
- Precision actuators for accurate positioning
- Durable chassis to withstand impacts
- Modular design for easy maintenance and upgrades

### Software

The mini robot is controlled by:

- Advanced path-planning algorithms
- Real-time sensor data processing
- Machine learning models for adaptive gameplay
- Wireless communication with the main air hockey system
