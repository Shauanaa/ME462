## 🎯 Project Abstract
This project integrates an IoT-enabled air hockey table with a remotely-controllable microrobot, creating diverse game scenarios. It showcases the fusion of mechanical engineering and software development to produce an interactive, entertaining system that reimagines classic gameplay through modern technology

## 🏒 AirHockey

### Mechanical

Our air hockey table is equipped with:

- High-powered air blowers
- Camera setup for object detection/tracking 
- LED lighting system for enhanced gameplay experience
- Remotely controllable side obstacles 

### Software

The air hockey system is powered by:

- Computer vision algorithms for real-time puck and leds
- Pip installable python code
  

## 🤖 Mini Robot

### Mechanical

The mini robot features:

- Compact, agile design for quick movements
- Remotely Controllable motors
- Durable chassis to withstand impacts
- Modular design for easy maintenance and upgrades

### Software

The mini robot is controlled by:

- Wireless communication with the main computer using socket connection

## 🖥️ How to Use the Code

To get started with the AirHockey and Mini Robot project, follow these steps:

#### 1. Clone the Repository
#### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:

#### 3. Configure the System
- Update the `config.py` file with your specific settings, including the IP address of the mini robot.

#### 4. Run the Air Hockey System

#### 5. Control the Mini Robot

#### 6. Additional Commands
- To calibrate the camera: `python calibrate_camera.py`
- To test the LED system: `python test_leds.py`

For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, please refer to the `docs` folder.


## ⚠️ Cautions

When using this system, please be aware of the following:

- The IP address of the microrobot changes when connecting to different networks. Always ensure you have the correct IP address before attempting to connect or control the microrobot.
